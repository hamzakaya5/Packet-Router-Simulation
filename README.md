# Packet-Router-Simulation

This code aims to simulate the behaviour of an ip router.
It produces packets and then according to the ip address of the packet, routes the packets to the queue (like the open ports).
According to the congestion ratio of the queue, it drops packets from queue by considering the packet priority.
